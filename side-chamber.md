# Explore the Side Chamber

You step into the side chamber, the air thick with dust and the scent of old relics. The chamber is dimly lit, but the center of the room draws your attention immediatelyâ€”a pedestal holding a glowing crystal. The crystal emits a soft, ethereal light, casting strange shadows on the walls. Its glow seems to pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat, as though it holds some form of life within it.
