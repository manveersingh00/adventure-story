# Enter the Temple

You push open the heavy, ornate doors of the temple, and they creak loudly as they reveal the dim interior. The air is cool and smells of aged stone and dust, carrying with it a sense of ancient mystery. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, the faint outlines of intricate murals covering the walls become visible, each telling a story of gods, rituals, and battles long forgotten by time.
