# Explore the Surroundings

You decide to stay outside and explore the temple's surroundings, feeling the crunch of dried leaves underfoot as you walk. The temple stands as a solitary sentinel amidst the encroaching wilderness, its ancient stone walls blending seamlessly with the overgrowth that threatens to reclaim it.
