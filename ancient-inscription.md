# Inspect the Ancient Inscription

You brush away the thick vines that have taken root over the inscription. As the vines fall away, a series of ancient symbols and carvings emerge, their meaning obscured by the passage of time. The symbols seem to tell a storyâ€”a tale of a civilization that once thrived here, worshipping gods who demanded both reverence and sacrifice.

Each symbol appears meticulously crafted, as if the artisans who carved them wanted to ensure their message would endure for eternity. At the center of the inscription, a larger figure stands out, possibly a deity or a guardian of the temple, its stern gaze seemingly watching over the temple's secrets.
